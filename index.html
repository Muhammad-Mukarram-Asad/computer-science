        <h2> What is <span> Computer Science </span> simply ?</h2>
        <p> Computer science is the study of computers and computing as well as their
             theoretical and practical applications. Computer science applies the principles 
             of mathematics, engineering, and logic to a plethora of functions, including 
             algorithm formulation, software and hardware development, and artificial 
             intelligence.
        </p>

        <h2> What are the sub-fields of <span> Computer Science </span>? </h2>
        <p> 
             Basically Computer science is considered as part of a family of <span id="five"> Five </span>
            separate yet interrelated disciplines and they are as follows:
             <ol>
                <li> Computer Engineering. </li>
                <li> Computer Science. </li>
                <li> Information Systems.</li>
                <li> Information Technology.</li>
                <li> Software Engineering.</li>
             </ol>
             <br>

                    Computer Science is considered as the <span id="mother">Mother of all Sciences </span>.

        <h2> Fields of computer science in detail: </h2>
        <p> Here are 15 computer science disciplines you can explore:</p>
        <ol>
            <h3> Artificial intelligence: </h3>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the study and design of systems that can <br>
                 function autonomously from human input. Examples of AI are <br>
                 programs that offer music recommendations based on your previous <br>
                  listening habits or programs that can play complex games like chess <br>
                   against a human competitor. Some AI studies focus on creating <br>
                   machines that can perform human tasks like visual perception or <br>
                   speech recognition. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses <br>
                    specifically on the possibility of creating a machine that can use <br>
                     algorithms and programming to mirror the processes of the human mind.<br>
            </p>

            <h3> Programming languages and logic: </h3>
            <p>
                Programming languages are an integral part of computer science <br>
                 because most other disciplines use programming languages to <br>
                 function. To use a computer, the programmer translates commands <br>
                  into a specific programming language the computer can read. The <br>
                  study of programming languages and logic focuses on designing these <br>
                  languages as well as analyzing them and characterizing and classifying <br>
                   their individual features. Practical application of this study includes <br>
                   optimizing these languages so they can write complex programs using the <br>
                   smallest amount of code that the computer can understand.<br>
            </p>

            <h3> Scientific computing applications: </h3>
            <p>
                Scientific computing applications is a study of computer science that <br>
                uses computer algorithms and modeling capabilities to predict the <br>
                outcome of scientific experiments that scientists can't conduct<br>
                physically. Some situations where scientific experiments need to be<br>
                conducted through models are:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Big in Scale: </b>
                        Some scientific experiments or research are simply too <br>
                         big to conduct an experiment accurately outside of a digital model,  <br>
                         such as predicting the progress of climate change and its effects.<br>
                    </li>

                    <li> <b> Dangerous:</b>
                        Some materials or chemical reactions may be too dangerous or <br>
                         unethical to conduct in-person, like experimenting with toxic <br>
                         or radioactive chemicals.     <br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b> Expensive: </b>
                        Some experiments or research are too expensive or time-consuming. <br>
                        Using scientific computing can help to speed up these processes for <br>
                        a fraction of the cost, such as repeatedly crash testing aircraft for<br>
                        safety optimization.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Scientific computing is multidisciplinary because it includes people who are experts <br>
                in the field that require the model,as well as the computer scientist <br>
                 to build the algorithms.<br>
